  - Real-time highlighting of active pattern elements
  - Color-coded highlighting based on pattern values
  - Smooth animations for visual feedback

### 3. Live Editing
- **Feature**: Hot-reload functionality with debounced pattern updates
- **Key Components**:
  - 400ms debounce delay for optimal performance
  - Live pattern updates during playback
  - Graceful error handling for live edits

### 4. Mobile Optimization
- **Feature**: Enhanced mobile experience
- **Key Components**:
  - Minimum 44px touch targets (48px on touch devices)
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes
  - Touch-optimized interaction patterns

## Test Cases

### Basic Functionality Tests

1. **Editor Loading Test**
   ```strudel
   note("c d e f").slow(2)
   ```
   - ✅ Editor should load with syntax highlighting
   - ✅ Play button should be 44px minimum
   - ✅ Pattern should compile and play

2. **Visual Highlighting Test**
   ```strudel
   "c d e f".note().slow(1)
   ```
   - ✅ Should see highlighting move across the pattern during playback
   - ✅ Highlighting should sync with audio timing
   - ✅ Colors should follow Obsidian theme

3. **Live Editing Test**
   ```strudel
   note("c3 d3 e3 f3").slow(2)
   ```
   - ✅ Start pattern playing
   - ✅ Edit the code (change notes, timing, etc.)
   - ✅ Pattern should update after 400ms delay
   - ✅ Should continue playing with new pattern

### Advanced Feature Tests

4. **Complex Pattern Highlighting**
   ```strudel
   stack(
     note("c d e f").slow(2),
     note("g a b c5").slow(3).delay(0.25)
   )
   ```
   - ✅ Multiple layers should highlight independently
   - ✅ Highlighting should work with nested patterns

5. **Mobile Touch Test**
   - ✅ Test on mobile device or browser dev tools
   - ✅ Touch targets should be appropriately sized
   - ✅ Touch events should trigger properly
   - ✅ No accidental activations

6. **Live Editing Performance Test**
   ```strudel
   note(sequence("c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "a", "b", "c5")).slow(4)
   ```
   - ✅ Rapidly edit the pattern
   - ✅ Debouncing should prevent excessive re-evaluation
   - ✅ UI should remain responsive

### Error Handling Tests

7. **Syntax Error During Live Edit**
   ```strudel
   note("c d e f".slow(2)  // Missing closing parenthesis
   ```
   - ✅ Error should be displayed gracefully
   - ✅ Pattern should continue playing previous version
   - ✅ Fix should restore functionality

8. **Editor Fallback Test**
   - ✅ If StrudelMirror fails to load, fallback code display should work
   - ✅ Basic functionality should still be available

## Validation Checklist

### Core Integration
- [x] StrudelMirror editor loads properly
- [x] Syntax highlighting is active
- [x] Pattern compilation works through StrudelMirror
- [x] Integration with Strudel's proven highlighting system

### Visual Features
- [x] Mini notation highlighting during playback
- [x] Smooth highlighting animations
- [x] Color coordination with Obsidian themes
- [x] Visual feedback for live editing

### Live Editing
- [x] Debounced pattern updates (400ms delay)
- [x] Live code changes update patterns during playback
- [x] Graceful error handling for invalid code
- [x] Performance optimization for rapid edits

### Mobile Experience
- [x] Touch targets meet 44px minimum (48px on touch devices)
- [x] Responsive design for different screen sizes
- [x] Touch event handling with proper feedback
- [x] Optimized layout for mobile screens

### Performance & Reliability
- [x] No memory leaks from editor instances
- [x] Proper cleanup on widget unload
- [x] Stable operation with multiple patterns
- [x] Fallback mechanisms for edge cases

## Known Limitations

1. **Editor Dependencies**: Requires @strudel/codemirror package
2. **Browser Compatibility**: CodeMirror requires modern browser features
3. **Performance**: Live editing may impact performance on lower-end devices
4. **Touch Precision**: Some complex editing may be challenging on small screens

## Next Steps

With Phase 3 complete, the plugin now offers:
- Professional-grade code editing with syntax highlighting
- Real-time visual feedback during pattern playback
- Live coding capabilities with hot-reload
- Optimized mobile experience

The implementation successfully integrates Strudel's proven CodeMirror system while maintaining Obsidian's design principles and user experience standards.

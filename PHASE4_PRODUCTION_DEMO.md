## üéµ Demo Patterns

### Demo 1: Basic Pattern with Enhanced Feedback
```strudel
note("c d e f").slow(2)
```
**Try this:**
1. Click play and observe the enhanced loading state
2. Notice the improved button styling and CSS icons
3. See the status updates during compilation and playback
4. Try switching themes to see seamless adaptation

### Demo 2: Complex Pattern for Performance Testing
```strudel
stack(
  note("c d e f").fast(2),
  note("g a b c5").slow(3).delay(0.25),
  note(sequence("c2", "d2", "e2", "f2")).fast(4)
).room(0.5)
```
**Try this:**
1. Play this complex pattern and observe performance metrics in console
2. Try live editing while the pattern plays
3. Notice the enhanced visual highlighting with smooth animations
4. Test error recovery by introducing syntax errors

### Demo 3: Shared Context with Error Handling
```strudel
// Define a shared variable
let bassPattern = note("c2 d2 e2 f2").slow(4);
```

```strudel
// Use the shared variable with error handling
bassPattern.add(12).room(0.3)
```
**Try this:**
1. Run the first block to define the variable
2. Run the second block to use it
3. Try using an undefined variable to see improved error messages
4. Notice how the error doesn't break the entire session

### Demo 4: Mobile and Accessibility Test
```strudel
note(sequence("c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "a", "b", "c5")).slow(8)
```
**Try this:**
1. Test on mobile device or resize browser window
2. Use keyboard navigation (Tab, Space, Enter)
3. Try with reduced motion enabled in OS settings
4. Test with high contrast mode enabled

### Demo 5: Memory Management Demo
**Create multiple patterns to test performance monitoring:**

```strudel
// Pattern 1
note("c d e f").slow(1)
```

```strudel
// Pattern 2
note("g a b c5").slow(1.5)
```

```strudel
// Pattern 3
stack(note("c"), note("e"), note("g")).fast(4)
```

**... continue creating patterns ...**

**Try this:**
1. Create 10+ patterns in a single note
2. Observe performance warnings in console
3. Switch between notes to see cleanup operations
4. Check browser memory usage over time

## üîß Testing the Production Features

### Audio Context Management
1. **Resume Test**: Start with audio context suspended (browser default)
2. **Recovery Test**: Disable browser audio and try to play
3. **Cleanup Test**: Switch between notes rapidly
4. **Performance Test**: Monitor console for memory usage warnings

### UI Polish & Theme Integration
1. **Theme Test**: Switch between light/dark themes during playback
2. **Loading Test**: Observe enhanced loading states on complex patterns
3. **Hover Test**: Check smooth button interactions and hover effects
4. **Focus Test**: Use keyboard navigation to test focus indicators

### Error Handling & Recovery
1. **Syntax Error**: Try `note("c d e f".slow(2)` (missing parenthesis)
2. **Variable Error**: Try using undefined variables
3. **Audio Error**: Disable/enable browser audio
4. **Network Error**: Disconnect network during pattern loading

### Mobile & Accessibility
1. **Touch Test**: Test button interactions on mobile/touch device
2. **Keyboard Test**: Navigate using only keyboard (Tab, Space, Enter)
3. **Screen Reader Test**: Test with screen reader if available
4. **Preferences Test**: Enable "Reduce Motion" and "High Contrast"

## üìä Performance Monitoring

The plugin now includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

### Console Output Examples
```
Strudel Plugin: Performance metrics: {patterns: 5, memory: 8192, uptime: 15000}
Strudel Plugin: High pattern count detected (11). Consider cleanup.
Notebook cleaned up: Example Note.md
High memory usage detected. Consider closing unused notes.
```

### Memory Usage Tracking
- Each pattern: ~1KB estimated usage
- Shared context: ~512B per variable
- Cleanup threshold: 50KB total usage
- Monitoring interval: 30 seconds

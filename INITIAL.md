in @demo.vue i have shown how to use the strudel packages api to use strudel

i want to turn strudel into an obsidian plugin.

when someone types

```strudel
s("hh hh")
```

it renders the strudelmirror with that code, editing within the editor also updates the markdown so closing it and reponing maintains the edits.

there will be one button that toggles between play and stop.

implement all feaetures i demonstrate. (except for predefined patterns)

implement the strudel config as plugin settings (use dropdown for font family and theme. theme has only a set number of aviable ones)
